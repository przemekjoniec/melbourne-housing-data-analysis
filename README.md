This project analyzes the housing market in Melbourne using **Excel** and **Power BI**.  
The dataset contains information about property sales such as type, location, number of rooms, car spots, building age, seller details, and price.  

The goal was to **clean the dataset**, perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and create **interactive dashboards** for better understanding of the housing market.

## 🧼 Data Cleaning
The raw dataset required significant preprocessing before analysis.  
Main cleaning steps included:

1. **Renaming columns** – to ensure clarity and readability.  
2. **Removing extra spaces** – trimmed leading/trailing whitespace.  
3. **Setting appropriate data categories**
4. **Handling missing values** – removed or imputed blank cells where necessary.  
5. **Expanding abbreviations** – replaced short codes with full names.
6. **Dropping irrelevant columns** – removed fields not relevant for the analysis.  
7. **Adding new calculated columns** – such as price per square meter, building age categories, etc.
